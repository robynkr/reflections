When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're working on different computers or when you're collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case you have changes that you don't want to be publicly available yet.
