How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug? By highlighting only the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Makes it easier to find changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: follow guidelines on committing, such as one commit per complete feature
Cons: may forget to commit and each commit becomes too large to be useful

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is geared to code files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log gives a summary of all changes and git diff gives details about the changes between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control makes it easy to revert to the last version that worked so breaking something is not permanent.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control for software code.
